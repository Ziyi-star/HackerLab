    "Hashing is a fundamental technique used for several purposes, including:\n",
    "Data Integrity: Hash functions can ensure data integrity by producing a unique fixed-size output (hash) for any given input. Any change in the data will alter the hash, signaling potential tampering.\n",
    "Efficient Data Retrieval: Hash functions are used in data structures like hash tables to quickly locate a data record given its search key.\n",
    "Cryptographic Applications: Hashing is integral to digital signatures, message integrity checks, and various forms of authentication and secure transmissions."

    "Breaking Password Systems: If an attacker can find a password that has the same hash as a user's actual password, they can gain unauthorized access without knowing the real password.\n",
